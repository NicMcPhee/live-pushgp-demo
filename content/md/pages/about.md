## An introduction to Push and PushGP

This was created as part of the
[GECCO 2019](https://gecco-2019.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage) tutorial on
Push and PushGP. The
[original Propel implementation of PushGP](https://github.com/thelmuth/propel)
was written by Tom Helmuth, and then heavily modified by
[Lee Spector](https://github.com/lspector/propel) and
[William Tozier](https://github.com/vaguery/propel).
[Nic McPhee](https://github.com/NicMcPhee/live-pushgp-demo) smashed some
variant of these into a form that runs in the browser.
